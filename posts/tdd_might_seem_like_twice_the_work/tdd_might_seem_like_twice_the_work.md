# Test-driven development might seem like twice the work — but you should do it anyway

Isn’t Test Driven Development (TDD) twice the work? Should you do it anyway?

The short answer to the first question is NO. On the surface, it may seem like without TDD, time is only required to create the feature. With TDD, you need time to create the test AND create the feature, thus doubling the development time required.

What you’re not considering is the amount of time required for QA testing and debugging when the feature isn’t performing properly.

> Case studies were conducted with three development teams at Microsoft and one at IBM that adopted TDD. The results of the case studies indicated that the pre-release defect density of the four products decreased between 40% and 90% relative to similar projects that did not use the TDD practice.

That 40–90% decrease in pre-release defects means that QA teams and customers weren’t finding and reporting those issues. Engineering wasn’t trying to recreate bugs and develop patches, all of which have associated costs.
